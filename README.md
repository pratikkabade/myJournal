This project was build for generating a Google Calendar link by giving the input.

Currently **not** published for **other users**.

Built with `TypeScript` and with basics of `React`

### Start Date is defined in the `./scr/config/Date.tsx` file

### Note

Firebase gives dual outputs on `onclick`

So wont be rolling out until the issue is fixed properly
