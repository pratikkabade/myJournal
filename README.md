This project was build for generating a Google Calendar link by giving the input.

Currently **not** published for **other users**.

Built with `TypeScript` and with basics of `React` 

and now backed up on `Google Firebase`.

### Start Date is defined in the `./scr/config/Date.tsx` file

### Note

1. For inputting the date, use the format `MM-DD-YYYY` (eg: 12-31-2020)

2. To convert **Google Calendar** `ics` file to `csv` file, use the [Open ICS](https://openicsfile.com/csv-convert.html)

    - Select `dtstart`, `dtend`, `summary` and if required `description`

3. Then use following command to *convert dates* to *required input*
```
="{from: '"&TEXT(A2,"mm-dd-yyyy")&"', to: '"&TEXT(B2,"mm-dd-yyyy")&"'},"
```
